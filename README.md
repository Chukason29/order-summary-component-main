### What I learned

I learnt how to structure my webpage to, in order to use Z-index effectively

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.desktop-svg {
  z-index: -1;
}
```

### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for z-index placement. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
